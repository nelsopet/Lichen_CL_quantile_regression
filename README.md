## Lichen Critical Loads Models

### What

These files are the input, analysis and output files for the 90th quantile regressions of lichen biomonitoring indices against air pollution and climate variables for CONUS published in:

### Definitions

A *critical load* for lichens is defined as the atmospheric deposition level associated with a 20\% decline in a lichen metric (species richness or abundance of certain sensitive groups) from its maximum.  This is repeated here for five lichen metrics and two elements (nitrogen and sulfur), based on 90th percentile nonlinear regression.
